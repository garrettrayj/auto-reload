Auto Reload
===========

Auto Reload is a Safari extension for automatically refreshing browser windows with recurring timers. The goal is to provide functionality with as few browser "add-on" side effects as possible. There's no javascript, the interface is all native controls, and no extra security permissions are required. The extension ships in a basic Mac app with instructions for enabling in Safari. The app is purely a wrapper and does not communicate with the extension.

The app/extension is available in the [Mac App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auto-reload/id1437349439).

Thank you for your app reviews, emails, and GitHub issues. All feedback is appreciated.
