Auto Reload
===========

Auto Reload is a Safari extension for automatically refreshing windows with recurring timers.
The main focus is providing said functionality with as few "add-on" side effects as possible.
There is no javascript, the interface is all native controls, and no additional permissions are required.
The extension ships in a basic Mac app with setup instructions.
The app is purely a wrapper and does not communicate with the extension.
